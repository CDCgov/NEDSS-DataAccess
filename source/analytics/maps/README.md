All these files are converted from Json to GeoJson using an online tool called, geojson.io 
https://geojson.io/#new&map=2/0/20

- And, now click on the **Open** button (next to the **New** in the Picture) and select the file that you would like in the pop up file explorer

- Once you selected your Json file and hit Open, you would see the map on the display based on the Json file provided and you will notice more lines of code added to the right side as shown

- Now click **Save** and choose **GeoJson** from the list of formats provided (and the download with start automatically)
